[BUG REPORT]
Issue: Duplicate Destinations in Explore Page
Date: 2026-02-08
Status: FIXED

[CAUSE]
The issue was not a runtime error, but intentional logic within the seeding script (`server/seed_explore.js`) designed to populate the UI for testing purposes.

Original Code Snippet (The Culprit):
const sampleData = [
    ...baseDestinations,
    // The following lines created copies of every destination with Roman numeral suffixes
    ...baseDestinations.map(d => ({ ...d, destination: d.destination + " II", category: "Adventure" })),
    ...baseDestinations.map(d => ({ ...d, destination: d.destination + " III", category: "Spiritual" })),
    ...baseDestinations.map(d => ({ ...d, destination: d.destination + " IV", category: "Mountains" })),
    ...baseDestinations.map(d => ({ ...d, destination: d.destination + " V", category: "Beach" })),
    ...baseDestinations.map(d => ({ ...d, destination: d.destination + " VI", category: "Culture" }))
];

This loop took the original authentic destinations (like "Goa", "Jaipur") and multiplied them 5 times, appending " II", " III", " IV", etc., and arbitrarily assigning them different categories (like putting Jaipur in "Mountains").

[RESOLUTION]
1. Removed the duplication logic entirely.
2. Replaced `sampleData` with a manually curated list of unique, rich destinations for every category.
3. Updated the database aggregation logic to strictly group by unique destination names to prevent future duplication.

[RESULT]
- No more "Goa IV" or "Jaipur V".
- "Jaipur" is correctly categorized as Culture, not Mountains.
- All data on the Explore page is now unique and authentically categorized.
